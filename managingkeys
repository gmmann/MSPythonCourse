Don't put keys in python scripts....

not in clear text


use environmental variables


values outside of your application
connecting to a database
determining operating system
settings which need to change
sensitive data


import outside
os_version = os.getenv('OS')
print(os_version)



don't hardcode sensitive info ever!!
 used dotenv for a simple solution
 add .env to .gitignore

consider full encryption options
Azure Key vault!  (marketing!!)


Azure has app services , configuration settings
with app settings
